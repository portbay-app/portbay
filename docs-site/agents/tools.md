title: PortBay MCP Tool Reference — All 58 Tools
description: "Complete reference for every tool and resource exposed by portbay-mcp: project registration, lifecycle controls, diagnostics, scaffolding, databases, groups, DNS, certificates, sandbox, runtimes, tunnels, HTTP inspector, and migration import."

# MCP Tool Reference

The full surface exposed by `portbay-mcp`. Every tool returns `structuredContent` (typed JSON Schema output) plus a plain-text mirror for clients that don't support structured content. Tools declare behavior annotations: `readOnlyHint` for read-only tools, `destructiveHint` for destructive ones, `idempotentHint` where applicable.

Tools are grouped into [toolsets](./index.md#governance) you can enable or disable with `--toolsets`.

**58 tools · 4 static resources · 2 resource templates**

## Projects toolset

### `portbay_list_projects` (read-only)

List every registered project with hostname, URL, and — when the daemon is running — live status, PID, and restart count. `daemon_reachable: false` means only registry data is shown; `status` will be `unknown`. Start here before acting.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `ListProjectsResult`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `daemon_reachable` | bool | Whether the Process Compose daemon answered. |
| `projects` | `ProjectSummary[]` | See [ProjectSummary](#projectsummary). |

---

### `portbay_status` (read-only)

Live runtime detail for one project or all projects. Returns the same shape as `portbay_list_projects` but filtered to the requested project(s).

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string? | Project id (slug). Omit to get all projects. |

**Returns:** `ListProjectsResult`

---

### `portbay_detect_project` (read-only)

Inspect a folder and return the detected framework plus suggested registration defaults: id, hostname, port, start command. Nothing is registered — a non-committal preview to confirm with the user before calling `portbay_add_project`.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | Absolute path to the folder to inspect. |

**Returns:** `DetectResult`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `suggested_php_version` | string? | PHP: version label, when detected. |

---

### `portbay_detect_workspace_apps` (read-only)

List the runnable apps inside a JS monorepo so the agent can register just one as a standalone PortBay project instead of a root turbo fan-out. Returns `null` for a plain (non-monorepo) folder — use `portbay_detect_project` instead for those. Each app entry carries suggested id, hostname, port, and start command ready for `portbay_add_project`.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | Absolute path to the folder to inspect (typically the monorepo root). |

**Returns:** `WorkspaceScanResult` or `null`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | string | Absolute path of the detected monorepo root. |
| `tool` | string | Package manager / build tool detected from the lockfile (`pnpm`, `npm`, `yarn`, `bun`). |
| `apps` | `WorkspaceAppSummary[]` | Runnable apps found in the monorepo (those declaring a `dev` script). |

`WorkspaceAppSummary` fields:

| `suggested_port` | number? | Dev-server port detected from the framework, when applicable. |
| `suggested_start_command` | string? | Shell command that starts this app in isolation. |

---

### `portbay_list_recipes` (read-only)

List the available stack recipes — named blueprints (`laravel`, `next`, `vite`, …) that compose a project's framework, language version, document root, and HTTPS in one step. Map the user's request to a recipe id, then call `portbay_setup_from_recipe`. A recipe with `composes_fully: false` also recommends a database or mail service that isn't auto-provisioned yet (the project still registers, with a warning).

No arguments.

**Returns:** `ListRecipesResult` — an object with a `recipes` array of `RecipeSummary`:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `composes_fully` | bool | `false` when a database or mail service is needed but not auto-provisioned. |

Current catalog: `next`, `vite`, `astro`, `node`, `static`, `php`, `laravel`, `symfony`, `statamic`.

---

### `portbay_add_project` (mutates state)

Register an existing local folder as a PortBay project. It gets a local hostname, optional HTTPS via mkcert, and managed start/stop. Omit `kind` to auto-detect the framework from the folder contents. Does **not** start the project — call `portbay_start` after, or use `portbay_setup` to register and start in one call.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | **Required.** Absolute path to the existing folder. |
| `name` | string? | Display name. Defaults to the folder name. |
| `hostname` | string? | Hostname without scheme. Defaults to `<slug>.<domain-suffix>`. |
| `kind` | string? | Framework (`next`, `vite`, `php`, `static`, `node`, `flutter`, `xcode`, `android`, `custom`). Omit to auto-detect. |
| `port` | number? | Dev server port. Omit for static / PHP-only projects. |
| `start_command` | string? | Shell command to start the dev server. Omit for Caddy-only projects. |
| `https` | bool? | Enable local HTTPS via mkcert. Default `true`. |
| `auto_start` | bool? | Start on daemon boot. Default `false`. |
| `php_version` | string? | PHP version label (e.g. `8.3`). PHP projects only. |
| `document_root` | string? | Relative document root (e.g. `public`). PHP projects only. |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

### `portbay_update_project` (mutates state · idempotent)

Patch fields on an existing project. Only the fields you provide are changed.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug). |
| `name` | string? | New display name. |
| `hostname` | string? | New hostname. Changing this re-issues the cert on the next reconcile. |
| `port` | number? | New dev server port. |
| `start_command` | string? | New start command. |
| `https` | bool? | Enable or disable HTTPS. |
| `auto_start` | bool? | Enable or disable auto-start on daemon boot. |
| `tags` | string[]? | Replace the project's tag list entirely. |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

### `portbay_remove_project` (mutates state · destructive)

Unregister a project and clean up its cert and `/etc/hosts` entry. Source files on disk are **not** touched. Confirm with the user before calling — this is irreversible from PortBay's side.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug). |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

### `portbay_export_config` (mutates state · idempotent)

Write a `.portbay.json` into the project folder so the setup can be committed and reproduced by teammates. Secret values are never written — only their names.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug). |

**Returns:** `ExportResult`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wrote` | string | Absolute path of the written `.portbay.json`. |
| `env_count` | number | Number of env vars written to the template. |
| `secret_names` | string[] | Names of secret vars (values not written). |

---

### `portbay_import_config` (mutates state)

Register a project from a committed `.portbay.json`. Pass the project folder path or the file path directly.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | **Required.** Absolute path to the folder containing `.portbay.json`, or to the file itself. |
| `secrets` | object? | Key → value map for declared secret env vars. Omitted secrets are registered as empty placeholders (a warning is returned listing them). |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

### `portbay_setup` (mutates state)

The one-call "set this up for me" flow: register an existing folder (auto-detecting the framework) and immediately start it, returning the live URL. Set `start_now: false` to register without starting.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | **Required.** Absolute path to the existing folder. |
| `name` | string? | Display name. |
| `hostname` | string? | Hostname without scheme. |
| `kind` | string? | Framework. Omit to auto-detect. |

| `https` | bool? | Enable HTTPS. Default `true`. |
| `start_now` | bool? | Start after registering. Default `true`. |
| `auto_launch` | bool? | If the daemon is down and `start_now` is `true`, open the PortBay app first. Default `false`. |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

### `portbay_setup_from_recipe` (mutates state)

Apply a named stack recipe to an existing folder: register it with the recipe's framework, language version, document root, and HTTPS, then start it. The fastest path when the user names a stack. Call `portbay_list_recipes` first to discover available recipe ids.

For a brand-new project that doesn't exist on disk yet, use `portbay_setup_from_template` instead.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recipe` | string | **Required.** Recipe id, e.g. `laravel`, `next`, `vite`. |
| `path` | string | **Required.** Absolute path to the existing project folder. |

| `php_version` | string? | Override the recipe's default PHP version. |
| `https` | bool? | Override the recipe's HTTPS default. |
| `start_now` | bool? | Start after registering. Default `true`. |
| `auto_launch` | bool? | If the daemon is down and `start_now` is `true`, open the app first. Default `false`. |

**Returns:** `OpResult`. If the recipe recommends a database or mail catcher that PortBay can't provision yet, the project is still registered and `warnings` describes what to add manually.

---

## Lifecycle toolset

Lifecycle tools require the PortBay daemon to be running. Without it, they return `SIDECAR_DOWN`. Pass `auto_launch: true` on `portbay_start` only when the user is at their machine and expects the app to open.

### `portbay_start` (mutates state · idempotent)

Start a registered project.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug). |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

### `portbay_stop` (mutates state · idempotent)

Stop a running project.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug). |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

### `portbay_restart` (mutates state · idempotent)

Restart a project (stop then start).

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug). |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

### `portbay_stop_all` (mutates state · idempotent)

Stop every running PortBay process. No arguments.

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

## Diagnostics toolset

### `portbay_logs` (read-only)

Return recent log output for a project. The first thing to read when a project won't start or is crash-looping. Requires the daemon.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug). |
| `lines` | number? | Trailing lines to return. Default `200`. |
| `offset` | number? | Offset into the log buffer (0 = newest). Default `0`. |

**Returns:** `LogsResult`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | The project id. |
| `lines` | string[] | Log lines, newest last. |

---

### `portbay_doctor` (read-only)

Run a grouped environment health check — the **same data** the CLI `portbay doctor` renders (both call one shared core, so they can't drift). Categories: **Core** (registry, daemon, `/etc/hosts`), **Web routing & TLS** (Caddy, mkcert, certs), **PHP runtimes**, **Services** (dnsmasq, Mailpit, databases), **Account & sharing**. Bundled sidecars (Caddy, mkcert, dnsmasq, Mailpit, cloudflared) are reported via PortBay's own probe and **never resolved from `$PATH`** — a foreign install is never mistaken for PortBay's own. Use when something is broken and you don't yet know what.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `DoctorReport`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | bool | `true` when no check returned `fail`. |
| `categories` | `DoctorCategory[]` | Each has `title` (string), `verdict` (`ok` / `warn` / `fail` — worst of its checks), and `checks`. |

Each entry in `checks` has `check` (string), `verdict` (`ok` / `warn` / `fail`), and `detail` (string).

---

### `portbay_sidecar_status` (read-only)

Report the state of PortBay's background services. Process Compose is probed directly over HTTP. Caddy, mkcert, dnsmasq, and Mailpit are managed by the daemon and reported as install-presence only (state `unknown` from outside the daemon). Use `portbay_doctor` for a fuller picture.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `SidecarStatusResult`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `daemon_reachable` | bool | Whether Process Compose answered. |
| `sidecars` | `SidecarReport[]` | Each report has `name`, `state` (`running` / `stopped` / `unknown`), and `detail`. |

---

## Scaffold toolset

### `portbay_setup_from_template` (mutates state)

Scaffold a brand-new project from a starter template into `parent_path/name`, then register it with PortBay. Runs the upstream scaffolder (`pnpm create` for JS frameworks, `composer create-project` for Laravel). This takes time and requires network access. `open_world_hint` is set on this tool because the scaffolder may reach the internet.

For a folder that already exists, use `portbay_add_project` or `portbay_setup_from_recipe` instead.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `template` | string | **Required.** One of: `nextjs`, `vite`, `astro`, `laravel`, `php`. |
| `parent_path` | string | **Required.** Absolute path to the directory the new folder is created inside. |
| `name` | string | **Required.** Name of the new folder to create under `parent_path`. |
| `start_now` | bool? | Start after registering. Default `false` (scaffolding can be slow; the agent usually reports the URL and lets the user start manually). |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

## Groups toolset

### `portbay_list_groups` (read-only)

List every project group registered with PortBay. Each group carries its member project ids, a `known_ids` subset (members that still exist in the registry), and a `member_count`. Use this to discover group ids before calling start/stop/restart/update/remove group tools.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `GroupSummary[]` — see [GroupSummary](#groupsummary).

---

### `portbay_create_group` (mutates state)

Create a named group of projects. Groups let you start, stop, or restart multiple projects in one call. The id is derived from `name` automatically, or pass an explicit `id`. Unknown project ids are tracked and surfaced via `known_ids` on list.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | **Required.** Human-readable display name (e.g. `"Backend services"`). |
| `id` | string? | Explicit group id (url-safe slug). Derived from `name` when omitted. |
| `project_ids` | string[] | Project ids (slugs) to include. May be empty — members can be added later via `portbay_update_group`. |

**Returns:** `GroupSummary`

---

### `portbay_update_group` (mutates state · idempotent)

Rename a group or replace its member list. Only the fields you set are changed. `project_ids` fully replaces the member list (not a merge).

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Group id (slug). |
| `name` | string? | New display name. Leave unset to keep the current name. |
| `project_ids` | string[]? | Full replacement member list. Leave unset to keep the current members. |

**Returns:** `GroupSummary`

---

### `portbay_remove_group` (mutates state · destructive)

Delete a group. Member projects are **not** affected — only the group record is removed. Confirm with the user first.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Group id (slug). |

**Returns:** `{}` (empty object on success)

---

### `portbay_start_group` (mutates state · idempotent)

Start every project in a group. Members without a managed process (e.g. mobile/Xcode projects) are counted as succeeded and skipped. Stale members (removed from the registry but still in the group) are counted as failed. Requires the daemon.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Group id (slug). |

**Returns:** `GroupFanoutResult` — see [GroupFanoutResult](#groupfanoutresult).

---

### `portbay_stop_group` (mutates state · idempotent)

Stop every project in a group. Members without a managed process are counted as succeeded and skipped. Requires the daemon.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Group id (slug). |

**Returns:** `GroupFanoutResult`

---

### `portbay_restart_group` (mutates state · idempotent)

Restart every project in a group (stop then start). Members without a managed process are counted as succeeded and skipped. Requires the daemon.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Group id (slug). |

**Returns:** `GroupFanoutResult`

---

## Tunnels toolset

These tools are read-only. Starting and stopping a Cloudflare tunnel share is done from the PortBay app.

### `portbay_list_tunnels` (read-only)

List active public tunnels. Each entry includes the project id, upstream URL, public share URL (or `null` while Cloudflare is still assigning one), running state, and origin reachability.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `TunnelStatus[]` — see [TunnelStatus](#tunnelstatus).

---

### `portbay_tunnel_status` (read-only)

Get the tunnel details for one project by id. Returns `null` when no tunnel exists for the given project.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug) whose tunnel to look up. |

**Returns:** `TunnelStatus` or `null`

---

## Runtimes toolset

### `portbay_list_runtimes` (read-only)

List every language PortBay knows about (PHP, Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, Bun, Flutter) with all detected installs, their source (Homebrew, asdf, mise, nvm, system, manual), and the configured default version. No daemon required. Installing a new language version and editing PHP FPM/ini config are done from the PortBay app.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `RuntimeLanguageSummary[]` — see [RuntimeLanguageSummary](#runtimelanguagesummary).

---

### `portbay_set_default_runtime` (mutates state · idempotent)

Set or clear the default version for a language. The default is inherited by new projects when no version-manager file (`.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, etc.) is detected. Omit `version` or pass `null` to clear the current default. The version must already be detected — call `portbay_list_runtimes` first.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lang` | string | **Required.** Language id: `php`, `node`, `python`, `bun`, `go`, `ruby`, `flutter`. |
| `version` | string? | Version label to set as default (e.g. `"8.3"`, `"20"`). Omit or `null` to clear. |

**Returns:** `RuntimeLanguageSummary[]` — updated list for the language.

---

### `portbay_add_runtime_path` (mutates state · idempotent)

Register an existing binary as a manual runtime install for a language. PortBay probes the binary for its version string — if it doesn't report one, the call is rejected. Deduplicates by canonical path.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lang` | string | **Required.** Language id (e.g. `php`, `node`). |
| `path` | string | **Required.** Absolute path to the runtime binary (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/php`). |

**Returns:** `RuntimeLanguageSummary[]` — updated list.

---

### `portbay_remove_runtime_path` (mutates state · idempotent)

Remove a manually-added runtime install by language id and version label. No-op when the version is not present or was not manually added.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lang` | string | **Required.** Language id (e.g. `php`, `node`). |
| `version` | string | **Required.** Version label as returned by `portbay_list_runtimes` (e.g. `"8.3"`). |

**Returns:** `RuntimeLanguageSummary[]` — updated list.

---

## Databases toolset

### `portbay_list_database_engines` (read-only)

List every database engine PortBay can manage (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Redis, MongoDB, Memcached), each with install state, detected version, default port, CLI-client availability, and a Homebrew install hint. Check here before `portbay_create_database` — installing an engine binary is done from the PortBay app.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `DatabaseEngineSummary[]`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Stable engine id: `mysql`, `postgres`, `mariadb`, `redis`, `mongo`, `memcached`. |

| `client_available` | bool | Whether the CLI client (`psql`, `mysql`, …) is available. |
| `install_hint` | string | Homebrew command to install the engine. |

---

### `portbay_list_databases` (read-only)

List the database instances PortBay manages, each with engine, port, connection URL, linked projects, and — when the daemon is running — live status. `daemon_reachable: false` means status reflects the registry only.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `ListDatabasesResult`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `daemon_reachable` | bool | Whether the daemon answered. |
| `instances` | `DatabaseInstanceSummary[]` | See [DatabaseInstanceSummary](#databaseinstancesummary). |

---

### `portbay_database_connection` (read-only)

Get connection details for one database instance: the connection URL plus the framework env vars (DATABASE_URL, DB_CONNECTION, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, …) PortBay injects into linked projects.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Database instance id (slug). |

| `env` | object | Key → value map of env vars PortBay injects into linked projects. |

---

### `portbay_create_database` (mutates state)

Provision and register a new database instance: PortBay initializes an isolated data directory, writes a config, and tracks the instance. The engine binary must already be installed (check with `portbay_list_database_engines`). The instance joins Process Compose after the app's next reconcile (≤30s); start it with `portbay_start_database`.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engine` | string | **Required.** Engine id: `mysql`, `postgres`, `mariadb`, `redis`, `mongo`, or `memcached`. |

**Returns:** `DatabaseOpResult`

---

### `portbay_remove_database` (mutates state · destructive)

Stop (best-effort) and unregister a database instance. By default the on-disk data is kept; pass `delete_data: true` to also delete the data directory (irreversible). Confirm with the user before deleting data.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Database instance id (slug). |
| `delete_data` | bool? | Also delete the on-disk data directory. Default `false`. |

**Returns:** `DatabaseOpResult`

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Database instance id (slug). |

**Returns:** `DatabaseOpResult`

---

### `portbay_stop_database` (mutates state · idempotent)

## DNS toolset

### `portbay_dns_status` (read-only)

Report local DNS state: the active domain suffix, whether `/etc/resolver/<suffix>` routes wildcard `*.suffix` to PortBay's dnsmasq (and on which port), whether the privileged helper is installed, and the persisted dnsmasq tuning. Starting/restarting dnsmasq and first-run resolver install are done from the PortBay app.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `DnsStatusResult`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `suffix` | string | The active domain suffix (e.g. `portbay.test`). |
| `resolver_installed` | bool | Whether `/etc/resolver/<suffix>` points wildcard `*.suffix` at PortBay's dnsmasq. |
| `resolver_path` | string | Path of the resolver file. |
| `resolver_port` | number? | Port the resolver file targets (parsed from the file). |
| `resolver_contents` | string? | Raw resolver-file contents for diagnostics; `null` when not installed. |
| `helper_available` | bool | Whether PortBay's privileged hosts/resolver helper is installed. |
| `dnsmasq` | object | Persisted dnsmasq settings: `cache_size`, `local_ttl`, `disable_negative_cache`. |

---

### `portbay_list_dns_records` (read-only)

List the names PortBay resolves: the wildcard `*.<suffix>` plus one row per project hostname, each tagged with how it's currently routed (`dnsmasq` via the resolver file, or `hosts` via `/etc/hosts`).

No arguments.

**Returns:** `DnsRecordSummary[]`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hostname` | string | The resolvable name. |
| `target` | string | Always loopback (`127.0.0.1`) for PortBay-managed names. |

| `routed_via` | string | `dnsmasq` when the resolver file routes this name; otherwise `hosts`. |

---

### `portbay_set_domain_suffix` (mutates state · destructive)

Change the local domain suffix (e.g. `test` → `localhost`). Rewrites **every** project hostname to the new suffix and drops their HTTPS cert directories (the app reissues certs and updates `/etc/hosts` on the next reconcile). Reserved public TLDs (`.com`, etc.) are rejected. High blast radius — confirm with the user first.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `suffix` | string | **Required.** New suffix (e.g. `test`, `localhost`, `portbay.test`). Reserved public TLDs are rejected. |

**Returns:** `SetDomainSuffixResult`

## Certs toolset

### `portbay_cert_info` (read-only)

Report local-HTTPS certificate metadata — file paths, issued/expiry dates, days until expiry, and DNS SANs — for one project (set `id`) or every project that has a cert (omit `id`). Reads cert files directly; no daemon required. A project with no cert yet is absent from the result.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string? | Project id to report on. Omit for all projects with a cert. |

**Returns:** `CertInfo[]`

| `sans` | string[] | DNS Subject Alternative Names on the cert. |

---

### `portbay_reissue_cert` (mutates state · idempotent)

Reissue a project's local-HTTPS certificate: deletes the current cert so the running PortBay app mints a fresh one and reloads Caddy on its next reconcile (≤30s). The mkcert CA must already be trusted — installing it into the system keychain is privileged and interactive, done from the PortBay app.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug). |

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

## Sandbox toolset

### `portbay_sandbox_status` (read-only)

Report Sandboxed Run state: per-project policy (enabled, network, ephemeral), whether this OS supports it (macOS only), whether `sandbox-exec` is present, the tier's sandbox cap, and how many projects are sandboxed. Set `id` for one project, omit for all.

| `scanned_lines` | number | How many log lines were scanned. |
| `violations` | string[] | The sandbox-denial lines found, in log order. |

---

### `portbay_enable_sandbox` (mutates state · idempotent)

Enable Sandboxed Run on a project (macOS only). Wraps the launch command in a Seatbelt profile that denies credential stores, browser data, and every `.env` outside the project. Fails closed if macOS rejects the profile. The instance is **not** started/restarted here — the app re-wraps the command on its next reconcile (≤30s), then call `portbay_restart` to run it confined. Community tiers cap concurrent sandboxed projects (check `portbay_sandbox_status`); Pro is unlimited.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug) to sandbox. |
| `network` | string? | Network access inside the sandbox: `loopback_only` (default), `outbound`, `full`, or `blocked`. |

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | bool | Success flag. |
| `detail` | string | Human-readable summary. |
| `project` | `SandboxProjectStatus` | Updated sandbox state for the project. |

---

### `portbay_disable_sandbox` (mutates state · idempotent)

Disable Sandboxed Run on a project. The change applies on the next restart. Works on any OS so a synced sandbox flag can always be cleared.

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | **Required.** Project id (slug). |

**Returns:** `SandboxOpResult`

---

## Inspector toolset

### `portbay_recent_requests` (read-only)

List recent HTTP requests Caddy handled (method, host, URI, status, duration, size, matched project), oldest→newest. Reads Caddy's access log off disk — works without the daemon; empty until the app has served traffic.

---

### `portbay_clear_requests` (mutates state · idempotent)

Truncate Caddy's access log so the request inspector starts fresh. Safe while the app is running — the live stream resumes from the next request.

No arguments.

**Returns:** `OpResult`

---

## Migrate toolset

### `portbay_detect_import_sources` (read-only)

### `portbay_import_projects` (mutates state)

Import sites from a migration source into the PortBay registry. Pass the `ids` to import (from `portbay_preview_import`), or set `all: true` to import every site. Returns which ids landed and which were skipped (with a reason). The running PortBay app provisions the new projects — certs, Caddy routes, `/etc/hosts` — on its next reconcile (≤30s).

| Arg | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | string | **Required.** The source tool to import from: `herd`, `servbay`, or `mamp`. |

## Resources

The server exposes read-only [MCP resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/resources) an agent can read into its context without making tool calls. All resources return `application/json`.

### Static resources

| URI | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `portbay://registry` | The full PortBay registry as JSON — every project and its config. |
| `portbay://doctor` | Environment health snapshot. Same data as `portbay_doctor`. |
| `portbay://sidecars` | Sidecar status snapshot. Same data as `portbay_sidecar_status`. |
| `portbay://recipes` | The stack-recipe catalog. Same data as `portbay_list_recipes`. |

### Resource templates

| URI template | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `portbay://projects/{id}` | Live status + config for a single project, by id. |
| `portbay://projects/{id}/logs` | Recent log tail for a single project (200 lines). |

---

## Error envelope (`isError`)

When a tool call fails, the result has `isError: true` and `structuredContent` carries PortBay's standard error envelope instead of the success type. The agent reads the envelope and can recover or tell the user the next step.

```json
{
  "code": "SIDECAR_DOWN",
  "whatHappened": "process-compose is not running",
  "whyItMatters": "Projects can't start until process-compose is running again.",
  "whoCausedIt": "system",
  "actions": [{ "label": "Restart process-compose", "command": "sidecars.restart_pc" }]
}
```

Resources do not have an `isError` channel. A failed resource read is reported as a protocol-level error.

Common error codes:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` | No project with that id in the registry. |
| `SIDECAR_DOWN` | Process Compose daemon not reachable — open the PortBay app. |
| `PORT_CONFLICT` | The configured port is in use. |
| `PROJECT_CAP_REACHED` | Project limit for the current tier reached. Sign in or upgrade to Pro. |
| `BAD_INPUT` | An argument was invalid, malformed, or a required path was missing. |
| `REGISTRY` | The registry file could not be read or written. |
| `INTERNAL` | Unexpected internal failure. |
